Use `RenderDevice::features`, `RenderDevice::limits`, and the `WgpuAdapterInfo` resource to get runtime information about the actual adapter, backend, features, and limits. NOTE: `Backends::DX12`, `Backends::METAL`, and `Backends::VULKAN` are enabled by default for non-web and the best choice is automatically selected. Web using the `webgl` feature uses `Backends::GL`. NOTE: If you want to use `Backends::GL` in a native app on Windows, you must use `ANGLE`. This is because wgpu requires EGL to create a GL context without a window and only ANGLE supports that."]]};
